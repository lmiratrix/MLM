A self-assessment ","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nI received numerous inquiries as to whether a given background is enough to take this course. Let me elaborate at length. The stated prerequisite to this course is S052, Stat 139, or equivalent, i.e., you have gone a bit beyond an applied course on linear regression (S040). Technically, if you have taken S040 or equivalent, you could take this course; the \"a bit beyond\" part is just wanting a bit more comfort with these foundational skills. More specifically, we greatly prefer you to have the following skills as a prerequisite for this course:\n\n-   You can calculate summary statistics and visualizations for data (the mean, standard deviation, scatterplots, histograms) using some sort of statistical software.\n\n-   You can load data into some sort of statistical software, use that software to fit a regression model, and then interpret the results of the model.\n\n-   You know how to include categorical covariates in a linear regression.\n\n-   You know what an interaction term in a linear regression model is, and ideally can add one to a model you are fitting.\n\n-   You can interpret confidence intervals and a p-values.\n\n-   You can write down a regression equation and identify what the covariates and parameters are in a presented regression equation.\n\nYou will have an easier time if you have some of the following skills and experiences as well:\n\n-   You have some experience with doing things in R (even a little helps here).\n\n-   You know what logistic regression is, and know how to fit a logistic regression model using some sort of statistical software.\n\n-   You have seen random intercept models before, as perhaps in S-052.\n\n-   You have seen regression with fixed effects for groups, as perhaps in an econometrics course.\n\n-   You have some experience doing quantitative research with real data in almost any capacity.\n\nIf you have a strong mathematical background, or strong comfort with math, or if you have a strong computer programming background, or strong comfort with that, then you can likely get a lot out of this course even if you do not have some of the above skills and knowledge.\n\nPeople from many, many different backgrounds take S043/Stat151. In general, the more background experience you have, the easier the course.  Even if you don't have as solid a background, you can still get a lot out of this course if you are willing to sign on for an intense experience. But *please* don't be surprised if you sign up for an intense experience... and it is really intense!\n\nTo get a very rough sense of what it might feel like, take the quiz below.\n\n## A self-assessment quiz {.unnumbered}\n\nTrying to figure out how S43 will be for you? ​Add up the points across the following categories:\n\n### **Work Experience** {.unnumbered}\n\n+0        I have no work experience with quantitative data, or\n\n+1        I have some work experience with quantitative data, or\n\n+2        I have substantial work experience with quantitative data\n\n### **Stat Courses** {.unnumbered}\n\n-2        I have no prior stat experience under my belt, or\n\n+1        I have taken a very intro stat course (e.g., S12) or have at least a little stat knowledge, or\n\n+3        I have taken a linear regression course (e.g., S30, S40), or\n\n+5        I have taken an intermediate or advanced stats course (e.g., S52 or beyond)\n\n+1 bonus if concurrently enrolling in S052\n\n+1 bonus if classes were comfortable for you\n\n### **Programming** {.unnumbered}\n\n+0        I have basically no experience doing computer programming, or\n\n+1        I have some experience doing computer programming, or\n\n+2        I have a lot of experience doing computer programming\n\n### **R Skills** {.unnumbered}\n\n+0        I have no real experience with R, or\n\n+1        I have a small bit of experience with R (e.g., ran scripts of it in S040), or\n\n+2        I have some experience with R (e.g., played around with scripts a bit in S040), or\n\n+3        I have substantial experience with R (e.g., write my own R code for my work)\n\n+1 bonus if learning R has been comfortable for you\n\n+1 bonus if you are comfortable with something like STATA\n\n### **Math** {.unnumbered}\n\n+0        I don't recall much math from my past education, or\n\n+1        I have taken (and somewhat remember) Calculus, or\n\n+2        I have taken classes beyond Calculus\n\n+1 bonus if classes were comfortable for you\n\n### **Other** {.unnumbered}\n\n+2        I am content with getting a B or taking the class SAT/UNSAT\n\n## Total the above\n\n**A VERY ROUGH recommendation is:**\n\n\\< 4:      **Danger**! Please email the instructor to talk about how this might go for you.\n\n4-6:      **It will be really hard**! You could take this course, but will likely find it will take much more time than a typical course. We would support you through this, but be warned that this could feel like a lot to take on.\n\n7-9:      **It will be hard**! There are lots of folks like you who are taking this course. The course will likely be a fair bit of work and could feel confusing/overwhelming at times. We would support you through this. At the end you will have learned a lot if you stick with it.\n\n10+:     **It will probably feel like a normal course**. No reservations. You can either work a reasonable amount and learn a lot about data science, or dig deeper to really go far with the skills we cover.\n\n14+:     **It will probably be a cake-walk.** You will learn some concepts but not have to work particularly hard in this course. We would still love to have you!\n\n**Students have historically said this course teaches you a lot; the question is just whether you have the time to allocate for the course. This quiz helps assess the time.**\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","highlight-style":"pygments","output-file":"self_assess.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
