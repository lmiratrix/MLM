regression, so you have an understanding of how to interpret regression coefficients.\nHowever, adding additional levels means that some of our interpretations also need to change.\nThis document is intended to provide a brief guide to how to do that.\n\n### Coefficients and indices at various levels of the model {#coefficients-and-indices-at-various-levels-of-the-model .unnumbered}\n\nBut before we even start, we need to talk about how we use different coefficients and letters at different levels of the model.\nThere isn't a single convention for how to do this, but we'll try to be consistent at least in this class.\n\nWe'll distinguish between two basic types of models, those that are multilevel and *not* longitudinal, and those that *are* longitudinal.\n\nAs a canonical example of the first type, let's consider the model we use in class, namely\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nmathach_{ij} &= \\beta_{0j[i]} + \\beta_{1j[i]}SES_i + \\varepsilon_i, \\\\\n\\beta_{0j} &= \\gamma_{00} +

\\rho\\sigma_0\\sigma_1\\\\\n\\rho\\sigma_0\\sigma_1 & \\sigma^2_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nHere are the features of the model to attend to.\nWhen referring to students (or other first-level units), we will use $i$ as a subscript.\n$X_i$ will indicate a measurement taken for the $i$th student.\nWhen referring to schools (or other second-level units), we will $j$ as a subscript.\n$X_j$ will indicate a measurement taken for the $j$th school.\nWhen we expand these models to include third-level units (e.g., districts), we will use the subscript $k$ for these units.\nI don't intend to go past that, although we could.\nWhen we introduce cross-classified models (i.e., models will non-nested hierarchies) we'll pick subscripts that are intended to be evocative.\n\nWe'll also try to be consistent when using coefficients.\nWe'll use the letter $\\beta$ (beta) to indicate regression coefficients measured at the first level.\nWe'll use the letter $\\gamma$ (gamma) to indicate regression coefficients measured at the second level.\nEventually we'll use the letter $\\xi$ (xi, or ksi) to indicate regression coefficients measured at the third level.\n\nWhen we subscript regression coefficients, we'll need a number of subscripts equal to the level of the model at which this coefficient has been entered.\nThe first subscript will indicate the level-1 coefficient with which this particular coefficient is associated, the second subscript will indicates the level-2 coefficient with which it is associated, and so on.\nThis means that each coefficient will have a number of subscripts equal to the level of the model.\nAs a really complicated example, if a coefficient is labeled as $\\xi_{021}$, this indicates that the coefficient is the first slope coefficient (the 1 at the end) in a model for the second level-2 slope coefficient (the 2 in the second position) in a model for the level-1 intercept.\nSimilarly, the first subscript in a random effect will indicate the level-1 coefficient with which it is associated, and the second will indicate the level-2 coefficient with which is is associated.\nRandom effects will always have one fewer subscript than the coefficients at that level.\nAs you can imagine, subscripts quickly get out of hand as we introduce more and more levels to a model.\n\nWe'll use $\\sigma^2_p$ to indicate the variance of the level-2 residual for the $p$th random effect (starting at 0 for the intercept).\nI'm not yet sure how to do the subscripting at level-3, and for now am hoping to just wing it.\nThe correlation between the $p$th and $q$th random effects will be subscripted $pq$, and correlations will always be identified with a $\\rho$ (rho, not p).\n\nLongitudinal models are similar, except for the subscripting.\nI'll always (probably) subscript the first level with $t$, for time.\nThe second level will become $i$ (assuming that we're looking at growth in students or other individuals), followed by $j$ for the third level (we probably won't include a fourth level).\n\n### Interpreting fixed effects {#interpreting-fixed-effects .unnumbered}\n\nOkay, that was complicated, although I think writing down definitions and rules is often more challenging than applying them.\nNow let's practice some interpretations, going back to our model.\n\nAt the first level, we interpret (almost) exactly as we would in a standard regression model.\nIf we have\n\n$$mathach_{ij} = \\beta_{0j[i]} + \\beta_{1j[i]}SES_i + \\varepsilon_i,$$\n\nthen we interpret $\\beta_{0j}$ as the predicted value of $mathach$ for a student of 0 SES (which represents the grand mean) *who is located in school* $j$.\nBecause this is a multilevel model, different schools have different intercepts.\nSimilarly, we can interpret $\\beta_{1j[i]}$ as the expected difference in math achievement associated with a one-unit difference in SES *for students in school* $j$.\nWe don't interpret it, but $\\varepsilon_i$ indicates the difference between what we observed for this student and what we predicted based on her or his school and SES.\n\nWe interpret the level-2 units depending on the coefficients they predict.\nFor the school-intercept we have\n\n$$\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}sector_j + u_{0j}.$$\n\nWe can interpret $\\gamma_{00}$ as the predicted intercept for schools for which $sector = j$ (i.e., public schools).\nWe can interpret $\\gamma_{01}$ as the predicted difference in school intercepts between Catholic and public schools.\nAlthough it's less common, we can also interpret the residual for school $j$, $u_{0j}$, because you can't tell me what to do.\n$u_{0j}$ represents the difference between the observed/inferred intercept for school $j$ and the predicted intercept.\n\nTurning to the model for the slope, we have\n\n$$\\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + \\gamma_{11}sector_j + u_{0j}.$$\n\nHere $\\gamma_{10}$ is the predicted slope for SES in public schools, while $\\gamma_{11}$ is the mean difference in slopes between Catholic and public school.\nFinally, $u_1j$ is the difference between the slope observed/inferred for school $j$ and the slope predicted by the model.\n\nWe can *also* interpret these coefficients at the student level.\nRewrite the model by substituting $\\beta_{0j} = \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}sector_j + u_{0j}$ and $\\beta_{1j} = \\gamma_{10} + \\gamma_{11}sector_j + u_{1j}$ to obtain\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\nmathach_i &= \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}sector_{j[i]} + u_{0j[i]} + (\\gamma_{10} + \\gamma_{11}sector_{j[i]} + u_{1j[i]})SES_i + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\n&= \\gamma_{00} + \\gamma_{01}sector_{j[i]} + \\gamma_{10}SES_i + \\gamma_{11}sector_{j[i]}SES_i + (u_{0j[i]} + u_{1j[i]}SES_i + \\varepsilon_i).\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nNow we can interpret these coefficients as in a typical one-level linear regression model.\n\n1.  $\\gamma_{00}$ is the predicted mean value of $mathach$ for students of $SES = 0$ in public schools;\n\n2.  $\\gamma_{01}$ is the predicted difference in $mathach$ between students of $SES = 0$ in Catholic schools and similar peers in public schools;\n\n3.  $\\gamma_{10}$ is the predicted difference in $mathach$ associated with a one-unit difference in SES for students in public schools; and\n\n4.  $\\gamma_{11}$ is the predicted difference in the above difference between students in Catholic schools and students in public schools.\n\nEither interpretation is acceptable, and you should base your decision on how you're framing your question.\n\n### Interpreting variance-covariance parameters {#interpreting-variance-covariance-parameters .unnumbered}\n\nNow we're going to turn to the variance-covariance matrix for the random offsets, namely\n\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\Sigma = \\begin{pmatrix}\nu_{0j}\\\\\nu_{1j}\\\\\n\\end{pmatrix} &\\sim  N\n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n0\\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\\!\\!,&\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\sigma^2_0 & \\rho\\sigma_0\\sigma_1\\\\\n\\rho\\sigma_0\\sigma_1 & \\sigma^2_1\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n\\end{aligned}$$\n\nThe variance of a random offset (e.g., $\\sigma_0^2$, the variance of $u_{0j}$) represents how variable the coefficient associated with that coefficient is, conditional on the variables in the model.\nThe correlations (e.g., $\\rho$, the only correlation in this model) represent the tendency of the random offsets to covary, i.e., to be associated with each other.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Interpreting your models (they won't interpret themselves!)\n\nSo, multilevel models sure are great, but they can also make
