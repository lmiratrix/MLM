relevel( kenya$treatment, ref = \"control\" )\nlevels( kenya$treatment )\n```\n\n## The mathematical model\n\nLet's fit a random slope model.\n\n*Level 1:* We have for individual $i$ in school $j$ at time $t$: \\[ Y\\_{ijt} = \\beta*{0ij} +* \\beta{1ij} (t-L) + \\epsilon\\_{ijt} \\]\n\n*Level 2:* Each individual has their own growth curve.\nTheir curve's slope and intercepts varies around the school means: \\[ \\beta*{0ij} =* \\gamma{00j} + \\gamma*{01} gender*{ij} + u\\_{0ij} \\] \\[ \\beta*{1ij} =* \\gamma{10j} + \\gamma*{11} gender*{ij} + u\\_{1ij} \\] We also have that $(u_{0ij}, u_{1ij})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix.\nWe are forcing the impact of gender to be constant across schools.\n\n*Level 3:* Finally our school mean slope and intercepts are \\[ \\gamma*{0j} =* \\mu{00} + w\\_{0i} \\] \\[ \\gamma*{1j} =* \\mu{10} + \\mu*{11} meat_j +* \\mu{12} milk_j + \\mu*{13} calorie_j + w*{1i} \\] For the rate of growth at a school we allow different slopes for different treatments (compared to baseline).\nThe milk, meat, and calorie are the three different treatments applied.\nWe also have that $(w_{0j}, w_{1j})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix: \\[\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{pmatrix}w_{j0}\\\\\nw_{j1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n```\n\\sim N\\left(\\left(\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\n```\n\\right), \\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\tau_{11} & \\tau_{12} \\\\\n\\tau_{12} & \\tau_{22} \n\\end{array}\n\\right]\\right) = \\sim N\\left(\\left(\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\n```\n\\right), \\Sigma\\_{sch} \\right) \\]\n\nThe $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$ are the slope and intercept for the overall population growth (this is what defines our marginal model).\n\nWe will use $L = 1$ to center the data at the first time point (so our intercept is expected ravens score at onset of the study).\n\n*Conceptual question:* Why do we not have treatment in the intercept for school?\nWhat would changing $L$ do to our model and this reasoning?\n\n## Fit the model\n\n```{r}\nlibrary( lme4 )\nkenya$rn = kenya$rn - 1 # center by L=1\nM1 = lmer( ravens ~ 1 + rn + gender*rn + treatment:rn + (1+rn|schoolid) + (1+rn|id:schoolid), \n           data=kenya )\ndisplay( M1 )\n```\n\nNow let's connect some pieces:\n\n-   $\\mu_{00} = 17.41$ and $\\mu_{11} = 0.59$. The initial score for boys is 17.4, on average, with an average gain of 0.59 per year for control schools.\n-   $\\gamma_{01} = -0.30$ and $\\gamma_{11} = -0.14$, giving estimates that girls score lower and gain slower than boys.\n-   The school-level variation in initial expected Raven scores is 0.45 (this is the standard deviation of $w_{0i}$), relatively small compared to the individual variation of 1.40 (this is the standard deviation of $u_{0ij}$).\n-   The correlation of the $u_{0ij}$ and $u_{1ij}$ is basically zero (estimated at -0.09).\n-   The random effects for school has a covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{sch}$ of \\[ \\widehat{\\Sigma}\\_{sch} = \\left[ \n    \\begin{array}{cc}\n    0.45^2 & 0.45 \\times 0.09 \\times -0.99 \\\\\n    . & 0.09^2 \n    \\end{array} \n    \\right] \\] The very negative correlation suggests an extrapolation effect, and that perhaps we could drop the random slope for schools.\n-   The treatment effects are estimated as $\\mu_{11}=0.17, \\mu_{12}=-0.13$, and $\\mu_{13}=-0.02$.\\\n-   P-values for these will not be small, however, as the standard errors are all 0.09.\n\nWe could try to look at uncertainty on our parameters using the `confint( M1 )` command, but it turns out that it crashes for this model.\nThis can happen, and our -0.99 correlation gives a hint as to why.\nLet's first drop the random slope and then try:\n\n```{r, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }\nM1B = lmer( ravens ~ rn + gender*rn + treatment:rn + (1|schoolid) + (1+rn|id:schoolid), \n           data=kenya )\ndisplay( M1B )\nconfint( M1B )\n```\n\nWe then have to puzzle out which confidence interval goes with what.\nThe `.sig01` is the variance of the kid (`id:schoolid`), which we can tell by the range it covers.\nThen the next must be correlation, and then the slope.\nThis tells us we have no confidence the school random intercept is away from 0 (`.sig04`).\n\n## Some quick plots\n\nWe can look at the empirical bayes intercepts:\n\n```{r}\nschools = data.frame( resid = ranef( M1 )$schoolid$`(Intercept)` )\nkids = data.frame( resid = ranef( M1 )$id$`(Intercept)` )\nresid = data.frame( resid = resid( M1 ) )\nresids = bind_rows( school=schools, child=kids, residual=resid, .id=\"type\" )\nresids$type = factor( resids$type, levels = c(\"school\",\"child\", \"residual\" ) )\n\nggplot( resids, aes( x = type, y = resid ) ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\nThis shows that the variation in occasion is much larger than kid, which is much larger than school.\n\nWe can calculate all the individual growth curves and plot those:\n\n```{r}\nkenya$predictions = predict( M1 )\nggplot( data=kenya, aes( x=rn, y=predictions, group=id ) ) +\n    facet_wrap( ~ schoolid, labeller = label_both) +\n    geom_line( alpha=0.3 )\n```\n\nGenerally individual curves are estimated to have positive slopes.\nThe schools visually look quite similar; any school variation is small compared to individual variation.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nThis will illustrate fitting a three level model (where we have time variation and then clusters) and extracting the various components from it.\nThis is a rough
