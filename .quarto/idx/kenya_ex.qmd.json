Their curve's slope and intercepts varies around the school means:\n$$ \\beta_{0ij} = \\gamma_{00j} + \\gamma_{01} gender_{ij} + u_{0ij} $$\n$$ \\beta_{1ij} = \\gamma_{10j} + \\gamma_{11} gender_{ij} + u_{1ij} $$\nWe also have that $(u_{0ij}, u_{1ij})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix.\nWe are forcing the impact of gender to be constant across schools, but are allowing girls and boys to grow at different rates.\nThe average growth rate of a school can be different, as represented by the $\\gamma_{10j}$.\n\n*Level 3:* Finally our school mean slope and intercepts are\n$$ \\gamma_{0j} = \\mu_{00} + w_{0i} $$\n$$ \\gamma_{1j} = \\mu_{10} + \\mu_{11} meat_j + \\mu_{12} milk_j + \\mu_{13} calorie_j + w_{1i}  $$\nFor the rate of growth at a school we allow different slopes for different treatments (compared to baseline).  The milk, meat, and calorie are the three different treatments applied.\nDue to random assignment, we do not expect treatment to be related to baseline outcome, so we do not have the treatment in the intercept term--this is rather unstandard and we would typically allow baseline differences to account for random imbalance in the treatment assignment. But we are following the textbook example here.\n\nWe also have that $(w_{0j}, w_{1j})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix:\n\n$$  \\begin{pmatrix}w_{j0}\\\\\nw_{j1}\n\\end{pmatrix} \\sim N\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\tau_{00} & \\tau_{01} \\\\\n & \\tau_{11} \n\\end{array}\n\\right]\\right) = N\\left(\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\\right), \\Sigma_{sch} \\right) $$\n\nThe $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$  are the slope and intercept for the overall population growth (this is what defines our marginal model).\n\nWe will use $L = 1$ to center the data at the first time point (so our intercept is expected ravens score at onset of the study).\n\n*Conceptual question:* What would changing $L$ do to our model and the reasoning about not having treatment in the intercept for school?\n\n\n## Fit the model\n\n```{r}\nlibrary( lme4 )\nkenya$rn = kenya$rn - 1 # center by L=1\nM1 = lmer( ravens ~ 1 + rn + gender*rn + treatment:rn + (1+rn|schoolid) + (1+rn|id:schoolid), \n           data=kenya )\ndisplay( M1 )\n```\n\nNow let's connect some pieces:\n\n* $\\mu_{00} = 17.41$ and $\\mu_{11} = 0.59$.  The initial score for boys is 17.4, on average, with an average gain of 0.59 per year for control schools.\n* $\\gamma_{01} = -0.30$ and $\\gamma_{11} = -0.14$, giving estimates that girls score lower and gain slower than boys.\n* The school-level variation in initial expected Raven scores is 0.45 (this is the standard deviation of $w_{0i}$), relatively small compared to the individual variation of 1.40 (this is the standard deviation of $u_{0ij}$). \n* The correlation of the $u_{0ij}$ and $u_{1ij}$ is basically zero (estimated at -0.09).\n* The random effects for school has a covariance matrix $\\Sigma_{sch}$ of \n$$ \\widehat{\\Sigma}_{sch} = \\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n0.45^2 & 0.45 \\times 0.09 \\times -0.99 \\\\\n. & 0.09^2 \n\\end{array} \n\\right] $$\nThe very negative correlation suggests an extrapolation effect, and that perhaps we could drop the random slope for schools.\n* The treatment effects are estimated as $\\mu_{11}=0.17, \\mu_{12}=-0.13$, and $\\mu_{13}=-0.02$.  \n* P-values for these will not be small, however, as the standard errors are all 0.09.\n\n\nWe could try to look at uncertainty on our parameters using the `confint( M1 )` command, but it turns out that it crashes for this model. This can happen, and our -0.99 correlation gives a hint as to why.  Let's first drop the random slope at the school level and then try:\n```{r, cache=TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE }\nM1B = lmer( ravens ~ rn + gender*rn + treatment:rn + (1|schoolid) + (1+rn|id:schoolid), \n           data=kenya )\ndisplay( M1B )\nconfint( M1B )\n```\nWe then have to puzzle out which confidence interval goes with what. The `.sig01` is the variance of the kid (`id:schoolid`), which we can tell by the range it covers.  Then the next must be correlation, and then the slope.\nThis tells us we have no confidence the school random intercept is away from 0 (`.sig04`).\n\n\n## Some quick plots\nWe can look at the Empirical Bayes intercepts:\n\n```{r, fig.height=2.5}\nschools = data.frame( resid = ranef( M1 )$schoolid$`(Intercept)` )\nkids = data.frame( resid = ranef( M1 )$id$`(Intercept)` )\nresid = data.frame( resid = resid( M1 ) )\nresids = bind_rows( school=schools, child=kids, residual=resid, .id=\"type\" )\nresids$type = factor( resids$type, levels = c(\"school\",\"child\", \"residual\" ) )\n\nggplot( resids, aes( x = type, y = resid ) ) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  coord_flip()\n```\n\nThis shows that the variation in occasion is much larger than kid, which is much larger than school.\n\nWe can calculate all the individual growth curves and plot those:\n\n```{r}\nkenya$predictions = predict( M1 )\nggplot( data=kenya, aes( x=rn, y=predictions, group=id ) ) +\n    facet_wrap( ~ schoolid, labeller = label_both) +\n    geom_line( alpha=0.3 )\n```\n\nGenerally individual curves are estimated to have positive slopes.  The schools visually look quite similar; any school variation is small compared to individual variation.\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nIn this case study, we illustrate fitting a three level model (where we have time variation and then clusters) and then extracting the various components from it.\nThis example is based on a dataset used in Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, chapter 8.10, but you don't really need that text.\n\nShoving a lot of things under the rug, in this case study we have five measurements on a collection of kids in Kenya across time. \nWe are interested in the impact of improved nutrition.
