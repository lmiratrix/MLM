average math achievement of its students, and we want to know how different schools are.\n\nThe naïve way of doing this is to estimate the mean math achievement for a sample of schools, and take the standard deviation (square root of variance) of this sample as a reasonable estimate.\nIn math terms, we would calculate $\\bar{Y}_j$ for each school $j$ and then use as our estimate $$\\widehat{\\tau^2} = var( \\bar{Y}_j ) = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{j=1}^J \\bar{Y}_j .$$ This will give a number that is too big.\nThe following is a math derivation on a simple scenario that illustrates why.\n\nFirst, pretend our Data Generation Process (DGP) is Mother Nature making a bunch of schools, and then for each school making a bunch of kids.\nOur model is that the schools are represented by school-level true mean math achievement, and the kids are made by adding an individual kid effect to the mean math achievement of their schools.\n\nSo we have $$\\alpha_j \\sim N( \\mu, \\tau^2 )$$ meaning each school is a random draw from a normal distribution with a mean $\\mu$ and a standard deviation $\\tau$.\nThese are the *true* means of the schools.\nWe wish we knew them, but we do not.\nInstead we see a sample of kids from the school and we hope the mean of the kids is close to this true mean $\\alpha_j$.\n\nFor any kid $i$ we have $$Y_i  = \\alpha_{j[i]} + \\epsilon_i$$ with $$\\epsilon_i \\sim N( 0, \\sigma^2 ).$$ These $\\epsilon_i$ are the classic residuals we are used to.\n\nFor the moment, assume each school $j$ has $n$ kids.\nThen the average observed math achievement is $$\\bar{Y}_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} Y_i ,$$ the average of all kids in the school.\nNote the \"$i : j[i] = j$\" term, which reads as \"$i$ for those $i$ where $j[i] = j$\" meaning \"sum over all students which go to school $j$.\"\n\nOk, so now we have math achievement for school $j$.\nWe then have $$\\bar{Y}_j = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} Y_i  = \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} \\alpha_{j[i]} + \\epsilon_i =   \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} \\alpha_j +  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} \\epsilon_i = \\alpha_j +  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j}\\epsilon_i = \\alpha_j + \\bar{\\epsilon}_j .$$ Here we have $\\bar{\\epsilon}_j = \\bar{Y}_j - \\alpha_j$, i.e., we have a school-level residual, the error in our estimate of $\\alpha_j$ using $\\bar{Y}_j$.\nThis residual is the sum of a bunch of student residuals, which we assume are all independent of each other.\nWhen you average a bunch of independent, identically distributed (i.i.d.) residuals, each with variance $\\sigma^2$, you get something which still has the same mean (of 0) but a smaller variance by a factor of $n$: $$var\\{ \\bar{\\epsilon_j} \\} = var\\{  \\frac{1}{n} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j\\}\\epsilon_i } = \\frac{1}{n^2} \\sum_{i : j[i] = j} var\\{ \\epsilon_i \\} =  \\frac{1}{n} \\sigma^2$$ This is the familiar result that the mean of a bunch of variables has a standard deviation $1/\\sqrt{n}$ of the original standard deviation (part of the Central Limit Theorem).\n\nWe can think of $\\bar{Y}_j$ as a random quantity, random for two reasons: school $j$ is a randomly made school, and the students in school $j$ are randomly made students.\nUnder the assumption that the students' error terms are independent of the school's mean math achievement we can easily calculate the variance of our estimator: $$var\\{ \\bar{Y}_j \\} = var\\{ \\alpha_j \\} + var\\{ \\bar{\\epsilon}_j \\} =   \\tau^2 +  \\frac{1}{n} \\sigma^2$$\n\nThis is bigger than our target of $\\tau^2$, the true variability in mean math achievement across schools.\nThe uncertainty in estimating the $\\alpha_j$ has entered into the variability.\n\nOur estimate $\\widehat{\\tau^2}$ will be an unbiased estimate of $\\tau^2 + \\frac{1}{n} \\sigma^2$.\nOne way to fix is to estimate $\\sigma^2$ and then adjust our estimate of the variance of $\\tau^2$ by subtracting $\\frac{1}{n} \\hat{\\sigma}^2$.\nAnother is to use multilevel modeling, which does this for us, in effect.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nSay we want to estimate the variability of mean math achievement across
