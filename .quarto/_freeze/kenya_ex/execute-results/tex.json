level model (where we have time variation and then clusters) and extracting the various components from it.\nThis is a rough document, but hopefully will be useful.\nThis example is based on a dataset used in Rabe-Hesketh and Skrondal, chapter 8.10, but you don't really need that text.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## Load the data\n\nWe first load the data.\nShoving a lot of things under the rug, we have five measurements on a collection of kids in Kenya across time.\nWe are interested in the impact of improved nutrition.\nThe children are clustered in schools.\nThis gives a three-level structure.\nThe schools were treated with different nutrition programs.\n\nIn the following we load the data and look at the first few lines.\nLots of variables!\nThe main ones are id (the identifier of the kid), treatment (the kind of treatment given to the school), schoolid (the identifier of the school), gender (the gender of the kid), and rn (the time variable).\nOur outcome is ravens (Raven's colored progressive matrices asssessment).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nkenya = read.dta( \"data/kenya.dta\" )\n\n# look at first 9 variables\nhead( kenya[1:9], 3 )\n```\n\n:::

\\[ Y\\_{ijt} = \\beta*{0ij} +* \\beta{1ij} (t-L) + \\epsilon\\_{ijt} \\]\n\n*Level 2:* Each individual has their own growth curve.\nTheir curve's slope and intercepts varies around the school means: \\[ \\beta*{0ij} =* \\gamma{00j} + \\gamma*{01} gender*{ij} + u\\_{0ij} \\] \\[ \\beta*{1ij} =* \\gamma{10j} + \\gamma*{11} gender*{ij} + u\\_{1ij} \\] We also have that $(u_{0ij}, u_{1ij})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix.\nWe are forcing the impact of gender to be constant across schools.\n\n*Level 3:* Finally our school mean slope and intercepts are \\[ \\gamma*{0j} =* \\mu{00} + w\\_{0i} \\] \\[ \\gamma*{1j} =* \\mu{10} + \\mu*{11} meat_j +* \\mu{12} milk_j + \\mu*{13} calorie_j + w*{1i} \\] For the rate of growth at a school we allow different slopes for different treatments (compared to baseline).\nThe milk, meat, and calorie are the three different treatments applied.\nWe also have that $(w_{0j}, w_{1j})$ are normally distributed with some 2x2 covariance matrix: \\[\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{pmatrix}w_{j0}\\\\\nw_{j1}\n\\end{pmatrix}\n```\n\n\n\\sim N\\left(\\left(\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\n```\n\n\n\\right), \\left[ \n\\begin{array}{cc}\n\\tau_{11} & \\tau_{12} \\\\\n\\tau_{12} & \\tau_{22} \n\\end{array}\n\\right]\\right) = \\sim N\\left(\\left(\n\n\n\n```{=tex}\n\\begin{array}{c}\n0 \\\\\n0\n\\end{array}\n```\n\n\n\\right), \\Sigma\\_{sch} \\right) \\]\n\nThe $\\mu_0$ and $\\mu_1$ are the slope and intercept for the overall population growth (this is what defines our marginal model).\n\nWe will use $L = 1$ to center the data at the first time point (so our intercept is expected ravens score at onset of the study).\n\n*Conceptual question:* Why do we not have treatment in the intercept for school?\nWhat would changing $L$ do to our model and this reasoning?\n\n## Fit the model\n\n\n\n:::
