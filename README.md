# Collection of handouts and materials for S043/Stat151: Multilevel and longitudinal data

This is the github repo for the code and whatnot that makes the on-line "textbook" served at https://lmiratrix.github.io/MLM/ 

The goal of this project is to make all the handouts for my multilevel modeling course easy to find, access and browse.

All comments welcome!
