Some of you have never used R before.
Some may have used R for years.
This section contains some tutorials on basic R functionality that will be helpful for data wrangling and visualization and will lay a strong foundation for the MLM applications later on.

Another great resource is the free online book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz).
